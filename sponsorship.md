JaVers is an Apache-licensed open source project and itâ€™s completely free to use.
 
JaVers is gaining momentum, the number of downloads from The Central is growing.
In July 2024, `javers-core` was downloaded nearly 1,000,000 times.

However, the effort required to maintain Javers and develop new features is also increasing.
Burnout among maintainers is a serious risk in open source projects, especially when we work for free.

**Our work is not sustainable without financial backing.**
